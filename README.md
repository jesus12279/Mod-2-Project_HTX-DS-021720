# Module 2 Project

You've made it through the second module of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

Now it's time to put that modeling practice to the test.

## The Project and The Data

For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging. The dataset can be found in the file `"kc_house_data.csv"`.

The description of the column names can be found in the `ColumnNames.md` file in this repository. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions relating to what the data means.

You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible. 

**Target audience:** non-technical people interested in using your findings to maximize their profit when selling their home. 

## The Deliverables

A shared Git repository should contain:

1. A **README** file listing group members, project goals, findings etc. The README should explain to any outside audience exactly how to follow your project from start to finish. While each iterative step does not need to be detailed here, there should be an explanation of the final model and how it compared to an initial baseline. 

    - An explanation of the metric (or metrics) used to compare model results is  expected. 
    - An exploration of future improvements and potential weaknesses in data/models is also expected.

2. At least one clean **Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project as well as comments/documentation explaining the code and the reasoning behind each step. Either within your main notebook or in successive notebooks, an iterative approach to modeling is shown, with details about the parameters and the results for each iteration. 

    - Be sure to explain your feature selection and feature engineering processes, and to consistently and clearly compare your models as you try new things.

3. A 5-10 minute **presentation** giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for *non-technical* stakeholders. Make sure to either add this presentation PDF to the repository or link to it in your README. Remember, this is where you explain to your *non-technical* audience the "SO WHAT", aka why they should care about all the work you did - how will this help a home owner maximize their potential profit when selling their home?

    - This is a *non-technical* presentation, and should not contain code, raw variable names, statistics jargon, or anything else that may confuse someone who hasn't been in this bootcamp! 
    - Feel free to utilize whatever tools at your disposal to create visualizations to convey your points - visuals built in Python are fine, but be sure they're polished for your presentation.

4. The data provided for this project, as well as a version of the cleaned data used in your modeling process.

Bonus: A **Video Walkthrough** of your non-technical presentation, or of a technical rundown of your project. Some common video recording tools used are Zoom, Quicktime, and Nimbus. After you record your presentation, publish it on a service like YouTube or Google Drive.

For a full list of expectations for this project, check out the [**Project 2 Rubric**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8P7EjqFYbCwA3X1Q6rJmi4tUww7cia7_819JZcak3w/edit#).

Your team is expected to check in with the instructor team at least once to outline the project plan and approach to the problem.

## Suggestions

![battle plan, from GIPHY](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUySTOigOUHucl3rfW/giphy.gif)

- Plan out your Git repository **BEFORE** you begin your project! Avoid merge headaches, work in different Jupyter notebooks, and Git commit whenever you make changes - aiming for at least twice a day! Get used to pulling/pushing in order to keep each other up to date.

- Plan out how you'll be cleaning your data - and make sure you're justifying each step you take in your documentation (code comments, markdown cells or the README)

    - Work together on this, since otherwise you'll both probably be doing the same things but separately!

- Plan out some ways to iteratively approach this problem and how you'll be doing the analysis/model improvements before you start coding. This is the place you can likely split up the work, but be sure to keep checking in with your partner - they likely are doing cool things that you may want to use!

- Save time at the end to clean up your notebook and repository, create and practice your presentation, and otherwise cross your t's/dot your i's.
